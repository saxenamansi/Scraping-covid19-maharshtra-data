The aim of this activity is to parse tabular data from Wikipedia for COVID-19 in your native state. Try the following

Search with the keyword "wikipedia covid 19 your-state-name" (Eg: wikipedia covid 19 uthrakhand) in google. Find the appropriate wikipedia link from the search results (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Uttarakhand).
